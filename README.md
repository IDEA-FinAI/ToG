## Project Structure
- `requirements.txt`: Pip environment file.
- `data/`: Evaluation datasets. See `data/README.md` for details.
- `CoT/`: CoT methods. See `CoT/README.md` for details.
- `eval/`: Evaluation script. See `eval/README.md` for details.
- `Freebase/`: Freebase environment setting. See `Freebase/README.md` for details.
- `Wikidata/`: Wikidata environment setting. See `Wikidata/README.md` for details.
- `tools/`: Common tools used in ToG. See `tools/README.md` for details.
- `ToG/`: Source codes.
  - `client.py`: Pre-defined Wikidata APIs, copy from `Wikidata/`.
  - `server_urls.txt`: Wikidata server urls, copy from `Wikidata/`.
  - `main_freebase.py`: The main file of ToG where Freebase as KG source. See `README.md` for details.
  - `main_wiki.py`: Same as above but using Wikidata as KG source. See `README.md` for details.
  - `prompt_list.py`: The prompts for the ToG to pruning, reasoning and generating.
  - `freebase_func.py`: All the functions used in `main_freebase.py`.
  - `wiki_func.py`: All the functions used in `main_wiki.py`.
  - `utils.py`: All the functions used in ToG.

## Get started
Before running ToG, please ensure that you have successfully installed either **Freebase** or **Wikidata** on your local machine. The comprehensive installation instructions and necessary configuration details can be found in the `README.md` file located within the respective folder.

The required libraries for running ToG can be found in `requirements.txt`.

When using the Wikidata service, copy the `client.py` and `server_urls.txt` files from the `Wikidata` directory into the `ToG` folder.


# How to run
See `ToG/` README.md

# How to eval
Upon obtaining the result file, such as `ToG_cwq.jsonl`, you should using the `jsonl2json.py` script from the `tools` directory to convert the `ToG_cwq.jsonl` to `ToG_cwq.json`. Then, evaluate using the script in the `eval` folder (see `README.md` in `eval` folder).
